After running gdb, I began scanning the asm for comparisons cmp.
I set breakpoints at the comparisons, and x/s looked into the registers.
Cmp performs a subtraction operation and stores the yeilded value into the 
destination register. Therefore I can conclude that the destination 
is also the string to be compared to. I set a breakpoint to check the
destination register $esi. x/s $esi was holding the string:
"cgugjrNivowqDxYvMYgwGLCbWqww"
When I ran the program and entered the string, I received the victory message.
